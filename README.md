This is a simple blockchain implemented with NodeJs and Typescript
using a cryptocurrency example

Run install npm( Node version 12 +)
Install typescript (npm install -D typescript @types/node)

A blockchain is broken down into 4 classes:
1.Transaction - Transfer funds from one user to another
2.Block - Container for multiple transactions
3.Chain - Linked list for blocks
4.Wallet - Allow people to send and receive funds

The mine method avoids double spending
